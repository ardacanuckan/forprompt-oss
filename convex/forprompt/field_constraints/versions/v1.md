Refine these constraints into clear rules.

Rules:
- Use imperative statements ("Do not...", "Always...", "Never...")
- Be specific about boundaries
- Group related constraints
- Prioritize the most important ones first
- Remove redundant or obvious rules

EXAMPLE:
Before: "Don't be rude and stay on topic"
After: "- Never use profanity or dismissive language\n- Decline requests outside the product domain politely\n- Do not make up information - say \"I don't know\" when uncertain"
