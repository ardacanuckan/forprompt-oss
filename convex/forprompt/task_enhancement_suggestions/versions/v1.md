2. **Explain**: Why this matters for prompt effectiveness

- **Tool Usage**: Incomplete or unclear tool instructions (if applicable)
- **Output Format**: Vague or missing format specifications
- **Real-World Gaps**: Scenarios the prompt doesn't handle well
- **Structure**: Poor organization or missing sections
</focus_areas>
