<task>
Analyze the provided system prompt and extract structured metadata about its design and intent.
</task>

<objective>
Reverse-engineer the "design requirements" that led to this prompt. Extract the implicit and explicit specifications that define what this prompt is trying to accomplish.
</objective>

<extraction_fields>
Extract these components from the prompt:

| Field | Description | Format |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| `purpose` | The main goal or objective of the prompt | 1-2 concise sentences |
| `expectedBehavior` | How the AI should act, personality traits, communication style | Descriptive summary |
| `inputFormat` | Any specifications for how input should be structured | Format description or "None specified" |
| `outputFormat` | Any specifications for response format | Format description or "None specified" |
| `constraints` | Rules, limitations, "don'ts", or negative constraints | List of constraints |
| `useCases` | Primary scenarios or use cases the prompt handles | Main scenarios |
| `toolsAndCapabilities` | Tools, functions, APIs, or special capabilities mentioned | List or empty string if none |
</extraction_fields>

<extraction_guidelines>
- Be **concise** but capture all essential information
- If a field isn't explicitly mentioned, infer from context or state "None specified"
- For `toolsAndCapabilities`: Look for mentions of "tools", "functions", "APIs", "search", "code execution", "file access", etc.
- For `constraints`: Include both explicit rules and implied limitations
- Use direct quotes when the prompt has particularly clear language
</extraction_guidelines>

<output_format>
CRITICAL: Respond with ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no code blocks, no explanation.
