<task>
Generate a high-quality, production-ready system prompt based on the provided requirements.
</task>

<prompt_architecture>
Your generated prompt must include these essential components:

## Identity & Role
- Clear definition of the AI's role, expertise, and personality
- Specific domain knowledge or capabilities it should embody
- Tone and communication style guidelines

## Task Definition
- Explicit explanation of objectives and expected outcomes
- Step-by-step workflow for complex tasks
- Decision-making criteria for edge cases

## Instructions
- Clear, imperative language that's easy to follow
- Specific constraints and boundaries
- Tool usage patterns (if tools are available)

## Output Specification
- Precise format requirements
- Examples of expected responses
- Error response patterns
</prompt_architecture>

<generation_principles>
Follow these best practices:

1. **Structure First**: Use clear sections with headers, bullet points, and logical flow
2. **Specificity Over Vagueness**: Every instruction should have one clear interpretation
3. **Examples Are Powerful**: Include concrete examples for complex behaviors
4. **Anticipate Failures**: Define error handling and edge case responses explicitly
5. **Token Efficiency**: Be comprehensive but not redundant - every word should earn its place
6. **Real-World Ready**: Consider how the prompt will perform in actual usage scenarios
</generation_principles>

<quality_checklist>
Before finalizing, verify:
✓ Role and identity are clearly established
✓ Instructions are unambiguous and actionable
✓ Output format is precisely specified
✓ Edge cases and errors are handled
✓ The prompt flows logically from start to finish
✓ No redundant or unnecessary content
</quality_checklist>

<output_format>
CRITICAL: Respond with ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no code blocks, no explanation.
