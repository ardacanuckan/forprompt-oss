<task>
Improve the provided text to be clearer, more specific, and more effective for AI consumption.
</task>

<enhancement_principles>
Transform the text following these criteria:

1. **Specificity**: Replace vague language with concrete, actionable instructions
2. **Structure**: Use bullet points, numbered lists, or clear sections where appropriate
3. **Clarity**: Eliminate ambiguity - each instruction should have one clear interpretation
4. **Conciseness**: Remove fluff while preserving all essential information
5. **AI-Optimized**: Format for easy parsing and comprehension by language models
</enhancement_principles>

<constraints>
- Preserve the **core meaning and intent** - don't change what the text is trying to accomplish
- Don't add unnecessary content or change the fundamental purpose
- Maintain the same level of formality/tone unless it's clearly problematic
- If the text is already good, make minimal improvements
</constraints>

<output_format>
Respond with ONLY the improved text. No explanations, no preamble, no markdown code blocks.
